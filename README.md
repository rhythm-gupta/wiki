WIKI
====
This is a wikipedia alternative. It was built when wikipedia was inaccessible from IITD's campus for a day. The site is live at: iitd.info/wiki

How it works?

There was a connection timeout when a request from IIT's server is sent to Wikipedia's server but the server was able to receive data from the rest of the internet. SO, placing a new server in between which would get the data from wikipedia and then send the data to us should do the trick. And it did.
